# Sampler Pmod AD1 project for Arty A7-35T developement board

The aim of this project is to create an easy way, HDL implemented, to visualise data coming from the analog to digital converter provided by the Pmod AD1. In this way, it is possible to characterise the ADC, perform some tests on the ADC performances, test some Digital Signal Processing (DSP) modules or to sample analog signals.

## Hardware used:
- Board: Arty A7-35T by Digilent ![Arty A7 35T](https://digilent.com/reference/_media/reference/programmable-logic/arty/arty-0.png)

- Pmod AD1 : ![Pmod AD1](https://cdn11.bigcommerce.com/s-7gavg/images/stencil/1280x1280/products/159/3375/Pmod_AD1_top_600__16998.1533766952.png?c=2)

## Software used:

- The software used is **Vivado 2021.1** by Xilinx

- The HDL language used is **SystemVerilog**

## IP catalogue
To build up the design I have used some IPs by Xilinx. These modules can be configurated from the **IP catalogue** in **Vivado**. 
To create your personal module follow these steps:
- Click on IP catalogue in the **Project flow navigator**
- Search for the desired IP. In our case the IPs used are the **XADC Wiziard** and the **FIFO generator**
- Click on the IP desired
- Customize the IP according to the fatures required
- Click on **Generate IP instance**
- Then you have to generate and synthesise the required files (Click on **Generate** in the pop-up window). 
- In the file manager, where you can see the **Source Hierarchy** click on the **IP sources** panel.
- In the path: IP_COMPONENT_NAME >> Instantiation template >> ...    you√¨ll find the two **Instantiation templates**, one written in **Verilog HDL** and the other in **VHDL**. Now you can instantiate your customised module into your design.

## Some resources
Here some useful online resources which I have used to develope this simple ADC sampler:
- Digilent reference webpage (Arty A7) : https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/arty-a7/start

## How to create a Vivado project
To build up a Vivado project, the following operations are required:
- Open Vivado
- Click on **New project**
- Give a name to the project and click on **Create project subdirectory** and click on **Next**
- Click on **RTL project**. Then, click **Next**
- Now choose all the sources files .v (if the files are written in verilog), .sv (if they are written in SystemVerilog), .vhd (if files are written in VHDL), click on **Scan and add RTL include files into the project** and **Copy sources into project**. Then, click on **Next**
- Import the **Costraint file** .xdc in the same manner as before.
- Now you need to select the **Target device**. To do this, select the **Boards** menu and search for **ARTY A7-35T**. To do this operation you need to install on your computer the **Digilent boards files**. This procedure is described at the following link https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/guides/installing-vivado-and-vitis if you use the latest versions of Vivado and Vitis unified platform or the following link https://digilent.com/reference/programmable-logic/guides/installing-vivado-and-sdk if you use Vivado and Vivado SDK. 
- Now it is possible to modify the project, run the synthesis, the implementation and the bitstream generation
